# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of our project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for the city of Des Moines, Iowa . One of the key factors we need to look at is datetime (tripduration). Using the month of August as an example will bring the best data, since it is the month where the bikes are used the most. We need to show an analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented for and what hours of the day and days of the week are the most popular times to rent a bike. Also, we will analyse what gender is the one that uses the bikes tha most. 
Before starting the analysis there was a modification to the .csv, we changed the column that records the trip duration to show hours, minutes and seconds. Once this was completed the new .csv was uploaded to Tableau and we were able to use the column to make the new visualizations.

# Results

Using the visualizations we created a story that show the information the we need to show the investors and try to persuade them to bring citibike to Des Moine, Iowa. The findings were the following:

- Total number of customers for the month of August 2019 were : 2.344.224
    -  Of the total customers 443,865 are temporary customers and 1,900,359 are subscribers.

#  Summary

One thing that stood out to me after doing all the visualizations was that Thursday was the most popular day to ride a bike in the afternoons. One of the visualizations that I would recommend doing is adding some more months to the database. Maybe see the usage of the bikes during the winter months. Also, take a look at the starting points and see which ones are the most used and compare to places of equal traffic in Des Moines.
